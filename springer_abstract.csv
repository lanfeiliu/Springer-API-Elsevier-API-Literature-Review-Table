The characteristics of steel slag and the effect of its application as a soil additive on the removal of nitrate from aqueous solution,"Liyun, Yang, Ping, Xu, Maomao, Yang, Hao, Bai",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2016-12-17,N/A,"This study examined the characteristics of nitrate removal from aqueous solution by steel slag and the feasibility of using steel slag as a soil additive to remove nitrate. Steel slag adsorbents were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared spectrum (IR spectrum). Adsorption isotherms and kinetics were also analysed. Various parameters were measured in a series of batch experiments, including the sorbent dose, grain size of steel slag, reaction time, initial concentration of nitrate nitrogen, relationship between Al, Fe and Si ions leached from the steel slag and residual nitrate in the aqueous solution. The nitrate adsorbing capacity increased with increasing amounts of steel slag. In addition, decreasing the grain diameter of steel slag also enhanced the adsorption efficiency. Nitrate removal from the aqueous solution was primarily related to Al, Fe, Si and Mn leached from the steel slag. The experimental data conformed to second-order kinetics and the Freundlich isothermal adsorption equation, indicating that the adsorption of nitrate by steel slag is chemisorption under the action of monolayer adsorption. Finally, it was determined that using steel slag as a soil additive to remove nitrate is a feasible strategy.",None,None,None
Protection Methods Against Sea-Level Rise Caused by Climatic Change: Case Study of the Nile Delta Coastal Zones,"Koraim, Ayman Sabry, Negm, Abdelazim",,2016-12-10,N/A,"The global mean surface temperature is projected to increase about 1–3.5°C by the year 2100 caused by a sea-level rise (SLR) of about 15–95 cm. Low gradient coastal landforms most susceptible to inundation include deltas, estuaries, beaches and barrier islands, and coral reefs. Without serious adaptation measures, millions of peoples will be displaced from their homes. Moreover, the loss of productive land, they will have serious implications on job opportunities, food availability, and population movement. In this paper, the current status of many countries in the world affected by rising sea levels is presented. Also, the methods and strategies that can be used to cope with the expected sea level rising are discussed briefly such as nourishment, barriers, coastal armoring, managed retreat, application of the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), use of floatable developments, etc. In addition, the different types of coastal dikes as widely used methods to protect the coasts from SLR are summarized.

Characterizing the Effects of Stormwater Mitigation on Nutrient Export and Stream Concentrations,"Bell, Colin D., McMillan, Sara K., Clinton, Sandra M., Jefferson, Anne J.",Environmental Management,2016-12-08,N/A,"Urbanization increases nutrient loading and lowers residence times for processing of reactive solutes, including nitrate, total dissolved nitrogen, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic carbon), which leads to increased stream concentrations and mass export. Stormwater control measures mitigate the impacts of urbanization, and have the potential to improve stream water quality, however the net effect instream is not well understood. We monitored two urban and two suburban watersheds in Charlotte, NC to determine if mitigation controlled the fraction of total mass export during storm, if development classification as either urban or suburban (defined by the age, density and distribution of urban development) controlled storm nutrient and carbon dynamics, and if stormwater control measures were able to change stream water chemistry. While average concentrations during stormflow were generally greater than baseflow, indicating that storms are important times of solute export, the fraction of storm-derived export was unrelated to mitigation by stormwater control measures. Development classification was generally not an important control on export of N and dissolved organic carbon. However, event mean concentrations of orthophosphate were higher at the suburban sites, possibly from greater fertilizer application. Stormwater control measures influenced instream water chemistry at only one site, which also had the greatest mitigated area, but differences between stormwater control measure outflow and stream water suggest the potential for water quality improvements. Together, results suggest stormwater control measures have the potential to decrease solute concentrations from urban runoff, but the type, location, and extent of urban development in the watershed may influence the magnitude of this effect.",None,None," Stormwater control measures influenced instream water chemistry at only one site, which also had the greatest mitigated area, but differences between stormwater control measure outflow and stream water suggest the potential for water quality improvements"
Designing Bioretention Areas for Stormwater Management,"Chin, David A.",Environmental Processes,2016-12-06,N/A,"Governing equations for designing bioretention areas for both flood control and water-quality control are developed, and a design protocol for applying these equations is also presented. Factors taken into account include the flood-control return period, the local intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) function, the catchment volumetric runoff coefficient, and the depth and infiltration capacity of the bioretention-area bowl. It is shown that the IDF functions nested within the conventional Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) rainfall distributions can be described by a common functional form, with different parameters for each of the four rainfall types. These extracted IDF functions are used to show that designing bioretention areas for flood control is more feasible in the western part of the United States that have Type I rainfall, compared to other parts of the county that have Types IA, II, and III rainfall. It is demonstrated that practical bioretention areas that are sized for water-quality control can also meet flood-control regulations in some areas.

Coupling human preferences with biophysical processes: modeling the effect of citizen attitudes on potential urban stormwater runoff,"Sun, Ning, Hall, Myrna",Urban Ecosystems,2016-12-01,N/A,"Green infrastructure (GI) is gaining wide popularity as a means to reduce urban stormwater runoff. The challenges to long-term success of many GI policies, however, depend on citizen understanding and willingness to be engaged in the process of GI implementation. In this study, we developed a conceptual model that incorporated human preferences and biophysical processes in a coupled manner to estimate stormwater runoff variation at the sewershed scale under different acceptable GI implementation scenarios. To investigate resident receptivity toward GI implementation, we conducted surveys in selected Syracuse sewersheds and developed the scenario of residents implementing rain barrels and rain gardens in their private properties based on the survey results. We simulated this scenario at the lot level using the model we developed within the framework of the EPA SWMM 5 model to estimate reductions in peak flow and total runoff volume for major storm events. With our model, we also tested the effect of planned government tree planting scenarios. The scenario simulations were applied in three urban sewersheds of varying socio-economic and biophysical structures in the City of Syracuse, New York. The simulation results indicated that both the “government participation” and “household participation” scenarios, compared to pre-GI-development conditions, would contribute to a modest reduction in stormwater peak flow (>4 %) and total runoff volume (>5 %) across the simulated sewersheds. This study provides decision makers with a scientific methodology to quantify how human decisions can shape ecosystem function, and thus support sustainable stormwater management planning while addressing citizen preferences and needs.",None,None,None

Multi-Objective Optimal Design of Detention Tanks in the Urban Stormwater Drainage System: LID Implementation and Analysis,"Duan, Huan-Feng, Li, Fei, Yan, Hexiang",Water Resources Management,2016-10-01,N/A,"Under the influences of climate change and rapid urbanization, extreme rainfall events become more and more intensive and the urban flooding issues have been frequently faced in many cities in the world. Previous practical and scientific experiences have demonstrated that appropriate utilization of detention facilities and low impact development (LID) devices for urban region design could be important and effective ways to the flooding control and drainage service management of an urban stormwater drainage system (USDS). This paper investigates the optimal design and application of detention tank network and LID devices for achieving these multiple objectives in the USDS. The framework and method of LID-based multi-objective optimal design of detention tanks in USDS is first developed in this study, and a practical case in SA city of China is then taken for the application. The results of this study confirm the feasibility and validity of the proposed methodological framework for the LID-based multi-objective optimal design of detention tanks in the USDS. Specifically, both total investment costs and flooding risk have been greatly reduced by the optimal implementation of the detention tank and LID measures. Meanwhile, the results indicate that the LID devices may have global effect to the flooding control and the detention tanks can be locally efficient to reduce the flooding risk. Finally, the findings of this study are discussed in the paper for their practical implications to the practical design and management of USDS.",None,None,None
Stormwater management and climate change: vulnerability and capacity for adaptation in urban and suburban contexts,"Moore, Trisha L., Gulliver, John S., Stack, Latham, Simpson, Michael H.",Climatic Change,2016-10-01,N/A,"Managing stormwater under climate uncertainty is a concern in both built-out communities and those continuing to undergo land use change. In this study, a suite of climate change scenarios were developed to represent a probable range of change in the 10-year recurrence interval design storm. The Environmental Protection Agency’s Stormwater Management Model was used to predict flooding due to undersized drainage components within watersheds representing a traditional, built-out urban area and a developing suburban area with intact green infrastructure corridors. Despite undersized infrastructure and flooding in both study watersheds, the risk of property damage in the suburban watershed was negligible across the range of scenarios even at projected build-out, due in part to flood storage capacity of the green infrastructure network. Adaptation approaches – including pipe upsizing, underground storage, and bioinfiltration – and costs were also modeled in both watersheds. In the built-out site, bioinfiltration practices were predicted to moderate both flooding and total adaptation costs even when implemented over a relatively modest (10 %) portion of the watershed; however, a substantial upgrade to gray stormwater infrastructure (pipes and storage chambers) was also needed to mitigate impacts. In the urbanizing community, maintaining an intact green infrastructure network was surmised to be the most cost-effective approach for enhancing the resilience of urban stormwater systems to climate uncertainties and urbanization.",None,None,None
Sustainable drainage system site assessment method using urban ecosystem services,"Mak, Chunglim, Scholz, Miklas, James, Philip",Urban Ecosystems,2016-09-06,N/A,"The United Kingdom’s recently updated approach to sustainable drainage enhanced biodiversity and amenity objectives by incorporating the ecosystem approach and the ecosystem services concept. However, cost-effective and reliable methods to appraise the biodiversity and amenity values of potential sustainable drainage system (SuDS) sites and their surrounding areas are still lacking, as is a method to enable designers to distinguish and link the amenity and biodiversity benefits that SuDS schemes can offer. In this paper, therefore, the authors propose two ecosystem services- and disservices-based methods (i.e. vegetation structure cover-abundance examination and cultural ecosystem services and disservices variables appraisal) to aid SuDS designers to distinguish and link amenity and biodiversity benefits, and allow initial site assessments to be performed in a cost-effective and reliable fashion. Forty-nine representative sites within Greater Manchester were selected to test the two methods. Amenity and biodiversity were successfully assessed and habitat for species, carbon sequestration, recreation and education ecosystem services scores were produced, which will support SuDS retrofit design decision-making. Large vegetated SuDS sites with permanent aquatic features were found to be most capable of enhancing biodiversity- and amenity-related ecosystem services. Habitat for species and recreation ecosystem services were also found to be positively linked to each other. Finally, waste bins on site were found to help reduce dog faeces and litter coverage.

Metal accumulation and hydraulic performance of bioretention systems after long-term operation,"Kluge, Björn, Markert, Arvid, Facklam, Michael, Sommer, Harald, Kaiser, Mathias, Pallasch, Matthias, Wessolek, Gerd",Journal of Soils and Sediments,2016-09-04,N/A,"PurposeStormwater bioretention systems are widely used to treat diffuse infiltration of runoff from paved surfaces and roofs. Substantial questions remain about the hydraulic performance and the accumulation of pollutants in systems over the long term. Data of metal accumulation of systems with operational times >10 years currently is limited. This study deals with the accumulation of metals in a variety of long-term operational bioretention systems (11–22 years) to derive further operation recommendations for the water authorities.Materials and methodsThe hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention systems in field was measured using a double ring infiltrometer. Media soil samples from 22 diverse designed systems were collected across the surface and at intervals up to a depth of 65 cm to determine the spatial accumulation of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd. Leaching experiments of selected bioretention media soils were derived to assess the metal leachability by water.Results and discussionThe hydraulic performance of most bioretention systems still met the technical guidelines of Germany even after long-term operation. Considerable metal accumulation occurred in the topsoil (0–20 cm). Median concentrations of all metals are highest at the soil surface (0–10 cm), decreasing with increasing depth. High concentrations were determined at the inflow points of the runoff waters, whereas concentrations at more than 1.5 m distance from the inflow were only slightly increased compared to the initial soil concentrations. Leachability tests have shown that most of the metals deposited in bioretention soils are only slightly water soluble. No concentrations exceeding the threshold values of the German Soil Contamination Ordinance for the pathway soil to groundwater could be determined.ConclusionsThe hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention systems is given even well after long-term operation. Most of the metal accumulation is concentrated in the top 20 cm; concentrations decrease rapidly and mostly reach background/initial concentrations after depths of 30 cm. The water-soluble metals are all below the trigger values of the German Soil Act. This underlines the strong retention capacity of long-term bioretention systems after long-term operational times.",None,None,None
"Integrating geoscience into undergraduate education about environment, society, and sustainability using place-based learning: three examples","Gosselin, David, Burian, Steven, Lutz, Tim, Maxson, Julie",Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences,2016-09-01,N/A,"From water to energy, and from climate change to natural hazards, the geosciences (marine, Earth, and atmospheric science) have an important role to play in addressing a wide range of societal issues, with particular relevance to how humans can live sustainably on Earth. Although arguably important to developing solutions for many societal issues, more often than not, students have limited exposure to the geosciences in high school or college. To address this geoscience literacy problem, the Interdisciplinary Teaching of Geoscience for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) Talent Expansion Center has engaged members of the geoscience community and their colleagues in allied disciplines to implement and support strategies to teach geoscience in the context of societal issues and vice versa. Place-based learning is a particularly useful educational practice in helping link geoscience concepts to societal issues and other disciplines. The three examples from three distinctly different institutions of higher education—University of Utah, Metropolitan State University, and West Chester University—demonstrate the use of place-based educational strategies to connect the geosciences to societal challenges. Each of these courses uses variations of place-based pedagogy to provide students from a variety of disciplines the opportunity to learn about geoscience concepts in the context of environmental challenges in their own area. Each example describes the course in the context of its institutional setting, student audience, type of course, and learning outcomes; the geoscience-related societal challenges addressed, a description of pedagogical strategies, basic assessment information, and reflections on lessons learned and recommendations. These three examples illustrate that local places—on-campus, the surrounding community, and regional landscapes—provide a plethora of opportunities for students to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world issues. The extent to which an instructor will take advantage of the place-based opportunities is only limited by the imagination of the instructor(s) and the extent to which they want to use these pedagogies to achieve their learning objectives. Teaching geoscience in the context of societal issues using place-based educational practices illuminate the process of geoscience and build interdisciplinary problem-solving skills that connect geoscience to economic, societal, and policy issues related to a range of issues. Students think critically, ask critical questions, reflect and act on viable alternatives, and acquire knowledge, skills, and training so they can make a real difference in the world.",None,None,None
Assessing the societal impacts of green demonstration homes: a Canadian case study,"Rehkopf, Alina, Rowlands, Ian H., Tobert, Danielle","Energy, Sustainability and Society",2016-08-01,N/A,"BackgroundThis article investigates the overall societal impacts of the REEP House for Sustainable Living (REEP House) in Kitchener, Canada.MethodsAvailable information on green demonstration homes (GDHs) is reviewed to identify their goals, past assessment practices and their impacts on different measures ranging from energy consumption to behavioural changes.

Estimating stormwater runoff for community gardens in New York City,"Gittleman, Mara, Farmer, Carson J.

The documented benefits of community gardens include food production, recreational opportunities, and a wide number of social benefits such as improving community stability, reducing crime, and physical and mental health benefits. While much of the literature cites community gardens as providing environmental benefits for cities, there is little empirical evidence of these benefits. Here we examine the stormwater runoff benefits of community gardens by comparing two methods to estimate absorption rates of stormwater runoff in urban community gardens of New York City. The first method uses general land cover classes as determined by a land cover dataset; the second methods adds a land cover specific to community gardens — raised beds, typically used for food production. We find that in addition to the stormwater mitigation performed by pervious surfaces within a garden site, community gardens in New York City may be retaining an additional 12 million gallons (~45 million liters) of stormwater annually due to the widespread use of raised beds with compost as a soil amendment.",None,None,None
"Towards a comprehensive green infrastructure typology: a systematic review of approaches, methods and typologies","Bartesaghi Koc, Carlos, Osmond, Paul, Peters, Alan",Urban Ecosystems,2016-07-09,N/A,"There is no consensus on a comprehensive classification for green infrastructure (GI). This is a consequence of the diversity of disciplines, application contexts, methods, terminologies, purposes and valuation criteria for which a GI typology is required. The aim of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the existing evidence on how GI is being categorised and characterised worldwide. We reviewed a total of 85 studies from 15 countries that were analysed for contextual trends, methods, parameters and typologies. Results show that relevant literature lacks a common terminology and that a universal typology for all scenarios is impractical. Analysis reveals that GI can be organised into four main GI categories: (a) tree canopy, (b) green open spaces, (c) green roofs and (d) vertical greenery systems (facades/walls). Green open spaces and tree canopy attracted the attention of researchers due to their complexity, variability and important roles in GI planning. Evidence suggests that a ternary approach in terms of the functional (purpose, use, services), structural (morphology) and configurational (spatial arrangements) attributes of GI should be applied for a more comprehensive classification. Although this approximation is inherently generic, since it can be used across different research disciplines, it is also sufficiently specific to be implemented for individual scopes, scenarios and settings. Further research is needed to develop a typology capable of responding to particular research aims and performance analyses based upon the findings discussed in this paper.",None,None," Evidence suggests that a ternary approach in terms of the functional (purpose, use, services), structural (morphology) and configurational (spatial arrangements) attributes of GI should be applied for a more comprehensive classification"

Sustainable urban drainage systems: examining the potential for green infrastructure-based stormwater management for Sub-Saharan cities,"Mguni, Patience, Herslund, Lise, Jensen, Marina Bergen",Natural Hazards,2016-06-01,N/A,"Green infrastructure (GI)-based approaches to urban drainage such as sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) could provide Sub-Saharan cities with an opportunity to address projected climate change impacts and existing deficits in their drainage infrastructure, even more so due to the synergies between an enhanced green infrastructure stock and sustainable urban development. The objective of this paper was to assess the theoretical value of using green infrastructure for stormwater management as an alternative and supplement to conventional pipe-based stormwater management systems. A SWOT analysis is performed to assess the potential that SUDS hold if adopted and implemented in Sub-Saharan cities. This analysis is based on a review of sustainable stormwater management as well as urban planning and governance literature. Results show that despite seemingly significant barriers to the adoption of SUDS in Sub-Saharan cities such as low prioritization on the urban agenda and lack of data among others, the concept may hold valuable potential for flood risk reduction, even more so due to its multi-functionality and synergies with urban agriculture, amenity and water supply.

Urban Stormwater Governance: The Need for a Paradigm Shift,"Dhakal, Krishna P., Chevalier, Lizette R.",Environmental Management,2016-05-01,N/A,"
Traditional urban stormwater management involves rapid removal of stormwater through centralized conveyance systems of curb–gutter–pipe networks. This results in many adverse impacts on the environment including hydrological disruption, groundwater depletion, downstream flooding, receiving water quality degradation, channel erosion, and stream ecosystem damage. In order to mitigate these adverse impacts, urban stormwater managers are increasingly using green infrastructure that promote on-site infiltration, restore hydrological functions of the landscape, and reduce surface runoff. Existing stormwater governance, however, is centralized and structured to support the conventional systems. This governance approach is not suited to the emerging distributed management approach, which involves multiple stakeholders including parcel owners, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. This incongruence between technology and governance calls for a paradigm shift in the governance from centralized and technocratic to distributed and participatory governance. This paper evaluates how five US cities have been adjusting their governance to address the discord. Finally, the paper proposes an alternative governance model, which provides a mechanism to involve stakeholders and implement distributed green infrastructure under an integrative framework.",None,None,None
Vacant urban lot soils and their potential to support ecosystem services,"Herrmann, Dustin L., Shuster, William D., Garmestani, Ahjond S.",Plant and Soil,2016-04-04,N/A,"AimsUrban soils are the basis of many ecosystem services in cities. Here, we examine formerly residential vacant lot soils in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, USA for their potential to provide multiple ecosystem services. We examine two key contrasts: 1) differences between cities and 2) differences within vacant lots created during demolition, specifically pre-existing (i.e., prior to demolition) soils outside of the building footprint and fill soils added within the former building’s footprint.MethodsDeep soil cores were collected from vacant lots in Cleveland and Detroit. Soil properties that are proxies for three ecosystem services were measured: hydraulic conductivity for stormwater retention, topsoil depth and soil nitrogen (N) level for support for plant growth, and soil carbon (C) content for C storage.ResultsBoth city and soil group contrasts created distinct ecosystem service provisioning based on proxy measures. Cleveland soils had greater hydraulic conductivity and greater soil C and N levels but thinner topsoil layers than Detroit. Within vacant lots of both cities, pre-existing soils had greater soil C and N levels, but lower hydraulic conductivity values than fill soils.ConclusionsSoil properties of vacant lots were generally suitable for providing multiple ecosystem services. City-level differences in soil properties created differences in ecosystem service potential between cities and these differences were evident in pre-existing and fill soils. When comparing between cities, though, fill soils were more similar than pre-existing soils indicating some homogenization of ecosystem service potential with greater redistribution of soil.",None,None,None
Retrofitting LID Practices into Existing Neighborhoods: Is It Worth It?,"Wright, Timothy J., Liu, Yaoze, Carroll, Natalie J., Ahiablame, Laurent M., Engel, Bernard A.",Environmental Management,2016-04-01,N/A,"
Low-impact development (LID) practices are gaining popularity as an approach to manage stormwater close to the source. LID practices reduce infrastructure requirements and help maintain hydrologic processes similar to predevelopment conditions. Studies have shown LID practices to be effective in reducing runoff and improving water quality. However, little has been done to aid decision makers in selecting the most effective practices for their needs and budgets. The long-term hydrologic impact assessment LID model was applied to four neighborhoods in Lafayette, Indiana using readily available data sources to compare LID practices by analyzing runoff volumes, implementation cost, and the approximate period needed to achieve payback on the investment. Depending on the LID practice and adoption level, 10–70 % reductions in runoff volumes could be achieved. The cost per cubic meter of runoff reduction was highly variable depending on the LID practice and the land use to which it was applied, ranging from around $3 to almost $600. In some cases the savings from reduced runoff volumes paid back the LID practice cost with interest in less than 3 years, while in other cases it was not possible to generate a payback. Decision makers need this information to establish realistic goals and make informed decisions regarding LID practices before moving into detailed designs, thereby saving time and resources.",None,None,None
Integrated simulation method for waterlogging and traffic congestion under urban rainstorms,"Su, Boni, Huang, Hong, Li, Yuntao",Natural Hazards,2016-03-01,N/A,"Heavy rainstorms are increasingly frequent events in urban areas. Urban rainstorms lead to road waterlogging and low visibility, which affect drivers’ behavior and can thus cause traffic congestion and potential accidents. It is important to study the mechanisms of waterlogging and traffic congestion caused by rainstorms to more effectively predict them and reduce losses. In this paper, an integrated simulation method to analyze the influence of urban rainstorms on waterlogging and traffic congestion was developed. Firstly, waterlogging simulation was conducted to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of water depth on roads based on an urban storm water model. Secondly, psychological questionnaires were distributed to study the drivers’ behavior during a rainstorm. Based on the psychological questionnaires’ results, the vehicles’ speed was estimated under different water depth and visibility conditions. Finally, a microscopic traffic simulation was carried out to predict the traffic condition using the results of the previous two parts. Case studies were conducted on a simplified road model. The effects of different parameters on waterlogging and traffic congestion were analyzed. Then the method was applied to an actual urban area in Beijing, and a detailed waterlogging situation and traffic situation were obtained. Alternate future scenarios of adding drains to mitigate waterlogging and traffic congestion during heavy rainstorms were simulated, and the method’s potential to assist in decision making for urban drainage system design was shown.

Doing the Hard Work Where it’s Easiest? Examining the Relationships Between Urban Greening Programs and Social and Ecological Characteristics,"Locke, Dexter H., Grove, J.

Previous research has examined variations in patterns of existing and possible tree canopy cover relative to different social theories. Less attention has been paid to the processes of how the current patterns of tree canopy cover have developed. The goal of this paper is to address this gap by examining current programs to increase tree canopy. This paper utilizes public records, administrative data, a geodemographic market segmentation database, and high-resolution land cover data to assess where programs work, who participates in these programs, and whom the programs fail to reach. Recruiting households to plant trees can be hard work. In this paper, we find that programs might be most successful where it is easiest but have the lowest need. Free or reduced-cost programs for tree planting on private lands were most effective in the most affluent neighborhoods of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD. These areas tended to also have the most existing tree canopy on both private residential lands and the public right of way.

In an urban mosaic, a myriad of social and ecological components factor into aggregating and managing land to maintain or increase the flow of ecosystem services associated with green spaces. Vacant lots (a form of urban green space) are being repurposed for multiple functions, such as habitat for biodiversity, including arthropods that provide pollination services to other green areas; to capture urban runoff that eases the burden on ageing wastewater systems and other civic infrastructure; and to reduce urban heat island effects.

Some have pointed to technological solutions to reduce vulnerabilities and to build resiliency into food, energy, and water systems (FEWS). While technological advances to upgrade human systems, e.g., in agriculture, urban planning, pollution abatement, and green energy development, are critical, these technical advances are insufficient on their own. Effective FEWS management depends on understanding human decision-making, including adaptations to new environmental, social, or economic changes and the responses of individuals and communities to new technologies intended to improve FEWS resilience and sustainability. This paper draws on multiple social science perspectives, including decision science, economics, and sociology, to consider the fundamental role that human behavior and adaptations play in FEWS. We discuss the importance of accounting for human behavior within a coupled human-natural systems framework in which a range of human adaptations and feedbacks are considered, including how humans might respond directly to press-pulse dynamics and indirectly through their adoption of new technology. Following a brief summary of key concepts of decision-making theory at individual and community scales, we then focus on migration and land use changes, the two types of human adaptations that are particularly important for FEWS modeling and management.

Nitrogen removal by three types of bioretention columns under wetting and drying regimes,"Tang, Ning-yuan, Li, Tian",Journal of Central South University,2016-02-01,N/A,"The behaviors of inorganic nitrogen species in three types of bioretention columns under an intermittently wetting regime were investigated. The mean NH4+—N, NO3−—N and total N (TN) removal efficiencies for the conventional bioretention column (Col. T1) are 71%, 1% and 41%, for layered bioretention column with less permeable soil layer (Col. T2) the efficiencies are 83%, 84% and 82%, and for the bioretention column with submerged zone (Col. T3) the values are 63%, 31% and 53%, respectively. The best nitrogen removal is obtained using Col. T2 with relatively low infiltration rate. Adsorption during runoff dosing and nitrification during the drying period are the primary NH4+—N removal pathways. Less permeable soil and the elevated outlet promote the formation of anoxic conditions. 30%–70% of NO3−—N applied to columns in a single repetition is denitrified during the draining period, suggesting that the draining period is an important timeframe for the removal of NO3−—N. Infiltration rate controls the contact time with media during the draining periods, greatly influencing the NO3−—N removal effects. Bioretention systems with infiltration rate ranging from 3 to 7 cm/h have a great potential to remove NO3−—N.",None,None," 30%–70% of NO3−—N applied to columns in a single repetition is denitrified during the draining period, suggesting that the draining period is an important timeframe for the removal of NO3−—N"
Bio-retention Systems for Storm Water Treatment and Management in Urban Systems,"Weerasundara, Lakshika, Nupearachchi, C. N., Kumarathilaka, Prasanna, Seshadri, Balaji, Bolan, Nanthi, Vithanage, Meththika",Phytoremediation,2016-01-01,N/A,"Among different anthropogenic activities, urbanization has greatly influenced the hydrological cycle. Due to increased impervious surfaces, the amount of infiltration has been reduced, thereby increasing the runoff volume leading to flood conditions even for low rainfall events. Storm water flow along these impermeable surfaces finally ends up in surface water reservoirs. Urban systems are fundamentally responsible for a lot of pollutants by different sources: vehicle, industries, atmospheric deposition, soil erosion, etc., which may release various types of pollutants such as metals, organics, nutrients, oil and grease, detergents, surfactants, etc., into the atmosphere. With the storm water runoff, these pollutants may end up in surface waters. This indicates the importance of storm water treatment. Although there are several storm water treatment methods available, low-cost environmental-friendly methods (e.g., bio-retention systems) will be more sustainable with urban systems. Bio-retention systems can manage storm water and improve water quality through containment and remediation of pollutants within the urban system. However, the limitation of these systems is its finite capacity to hold contaminants. Hence, suitable plants grown along the bio-retention systems will be an effective phytoremediation option to address the challenges encountered in these remedial systems.",None,None,None

Phytoremediation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Urban Atmospheric Deposition Using Bio-retention Systems,"Weerasundara, Lakshika, Vithanage, Meththika",Phytoremediation,2016-01-01,N/A,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous compounds in urban environment and pose a great concern in environmental pollution due to their carcinogenicity. The inefficient fuel combustion is the major cause for the emission of PAHs in urban atmosphere. The emitted PAHs are either in particulate or in vapor phase however finally end up with deposition and directed into water reservoirs or groundwater table via storm water. Instead of conventional techniques such as solvent extraction, chemical oxidation, photocatalytic degradation, electrokinetic remediation, and thermal technologies, bio-retention systems can be used to remediate PAHs in storm water. However, bio-retention system does not facilitate the degradation or removal of PAHs, instead it facilitates the accumulation of PAHs in the soil. The use of phytoremediation in bio-retention systems is a hybrid technology that can provide efficient PAH removal by cutting down the biochemical cycling of PAHs. Although phytoremediation and bio-retentions systems are well-established technologies, their combination is rarely used. This chapter discusses the possibility of the use of phytoremediation in bio-retention systems, for remediation of deposited PAHs in the urban environment. Bio-retention systems with phytoremediation not only remediate PAHs but also reduce other pollutants such as heavy metals, nutrients, enhance the esthetic value, and create opportunities to produce biomass for bio-fuel production.",None,None,None
"Irrigating Urban Agriculture with Harvested Rainwater: Case Study in Roanoke, Virginia, USA","Parece, Tammy E., Lumpkin, Malayshia, Campbell, James B.",Sustainable Water Management in Urban Environments,2016-01-01,N/A,"Considered at the global scale, urbanization forms the principal source of landscape change. Worldwide, urban areas are increasing in size, both in land area and in population, causing losses of vegetated lands, increases in impervious surface cover, and increased demands on existing infrastructure and upon municipal services such as water and waste management. Urbanization, by reducing vegetative cover and increasing impervious surfaces, alters hydrologic cycles by reducing infiltration, increasing runoff volume and rates, lowering groundwater tables, decreasing evapotranspiration, and creating precipitation anomalies. Urban greenspaces are recognized as providing environmental benefits, including reduced stormwater runoff, increased evapotranspiration, and increased subsurface infiltration, which, in turn, raise groundwater tables. Urban agriculture forms a greenspace that can provide these environmental benefits, among others, in addition to contributing to food security for local populations. This chapter provides an overview of urban agriculture and its potential benefits. Then, we provide a case study based upon the City of Roanoke, Virginia, USA. We identify areas of existing urban agriculture using aerial imagery. We discuss land available for potential new urban agricultural sites. From aerial images and city geospatial data, we identify and calculate roof areas that can be used to capture rainwater. Then using precipitation data and equations identified from the literature, we calculated amounts of rainwater that could be harvested to provide irrigation water for these locations. Finally, we discuss reductions that could occur in stormwater runoff and greenhouse gas emissions if harvested rainwater were used instead of municipal water supplies. Additionally, we discuss future research areas for urban agriculture and rainwater harvesting.",None,None,None

A multifunctional green infrastructure design to protect and improve native biodiversity in Rio de Janeiro,"Herzog, Cecilia Polacow",Landscape and Ecological Engineering,2016-01-01,N/A,"The city of Rio de Janeiro now covers what was formerly coastal Atlantic rainforest. Native biodiversity has been lost from most of the metropolitan area due to changes in land use, introduction of exotic species, and influence of foreign designs in public and private parks and gardens. This paper presents a multifunctional green infrastructure planning proposal to protect and regenerate native biodiversity in the last remaining natural ecosystem fragments in a watershed within the city’s limits. The proposal is based on social–ecological assessments and analyses. The watershed contains an extensive mangrove remnant surrounded by a protected massif partially covered by coastal Atlantic rainforest and is one of the very last productive landscapes where residents experience a strong sense of place. The strategy is to reconcile urban development with environmental achievements to conserve existing ecosystem patches, which will be connected by way of riparian corridors and other open spaces, such as streets, private yards and public areas, by using native species and ecological design. The green infrastructure framework is planned at the watershed scale. On a neighborhood and local scale, the plan is to promote public participation, develop new ecological aesthetics, encourage the planting of native species, and establish an innovative circulation system within a low-impact design framework to achieve various abiotic, biotic, and cultural goals. In addition to the economic benefits, accessible food production, rural tourism and ecotourism have the potential to unite people and nature within the city.",None,None,None
Can School Gardens Deepen Children’s Connection to Nature?,"Wake, Susan J., Birdsall, Sally","Space, Place, and Environment",2016-01-01,N/A,"This chapter is a review of school gardens and their potential for deepening children’s connection to nature. School gardens are currently experiencing a resurgence in popularity in many Western countries following their decline after WWII. Rationales for contemporary school gardens are focused on issues that today’s children face, such as inflexible education systems, obesity, diminishing experiences with nature, and a lack of physical activity. Although lauded by their champions (e.g., researchers, educational and landscape professionals, celebrities), the school garden remains a tenuous construct both as an entity and an educational tool. This is due to lack of consistent empirical evidence about their role in learning, plus their reliance on teacher knowledge and commitment, fundraising potential, and volunteer assistance.Yet school gardens can provide spaces for many experiences in nature ranging from play, exercise, and socialization to learning in maths, science, and environmental education. The focus of this chapter is examining their potential for environmental learning and fostering positive environmental experiences and attitudes.It is proposed that many current school gardens may be limited both in their scope and levels of children’s participation, especially in areas such as planning and design. It is recommended that partnerships between schools and their wider communities (e.g., landscape architects) could result in more diverse school garden models that go beyond “vege” gardens in contributing both to environmental learning and promoting biodiversity. Empowering children through inclusion within such partnerships can lead to transformative learning. This type of learning could contribute to building resilient children who see themselves as future guardians of the Earth.",None,None,None

The history and impacts of “traditional” methods of managing urban streams by placing them in underground pipes are presented and then challenged by proposing daylighting as an alternative urban stormwater management technique. We explore methods of site selection, stream analysis, and natural stream channel design along with construction considerations in urban environments. We review four case studies in the USA demonstrating the most common daylighted stream channel types, which address some of the specific issues and outcomes of current urban stream daylighting efforts. Compared with case study research in 2006–2007, the majority of daylighting projects are now being utilized to manage stormwater volume in an effort to prevent flooding in downtown business and residential districts. Improvements to water quality and habitat corridors are also important, but are secondary to urban flood control. Our conclusions indicate that urban stream daylighting projects are on the rise across the country, in both urban and rural city centers, but that costs and technical complexity are also on the rise due to heavy urban site constraints and limited available land for establishing more naturalized stream channels.",None," Our conclusions indicate that urban stream daylighting projects are on the rise across the country, in both urban and rural city centers, but that costs and technical complexity are also on the rise due to heavy urban site constraints and limited available land for establishing more naturalized stream channels",None

Urban Stormwater Management: Evolution of Process and Technology,"Hirschman, David, Battiata, Joseph",Sustainable Water Management in Urban Environments,2016-01-01,N/A,"The practice of urban stormwater management has evolved over the course of several decades. Initially, stormwater management concerned itself primarily with abating downstream flooding and was the sole domain of engineers. As the regulatory climate changed over time, so did design philosophy, along with the types of management practices, the computational methods, and the prominence of stormwater management as an integral part of the overall site planning process. The milestones of this evolution include the addition of stormwater quality treatment as a regulatory standard and, more recently, a focus on reducing the overall volume of runoff through the use of small-scale, distributed management practices (often under the banner of Low-Impact Development or Environmental Site Design). The volume reduction strategy, referred to as “runoff reduction,” has been adopted as a regulatory standard in some parts of the USA, along with new stormwater practice design specifications and computational methods. The approach demands that stormwater design reach beyond sole reliance on engineering, as the new best management practices (BMPs) include site design strategies that incorporate elements of soil science, horticulture, landscape architecture, and, importantly, site planning. These new strategies have certainly been elevated to prominence by virtue of the hydrologic benefits but also by the integration of stormwater management into Clean Water Act permits and Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) assigned to impaired urban streams and receiving waterbodies. This chapter will outline the evolution of stormwater management regulatory goals and the corresponding design strategies and include examples of how these approaches are changing the structural and nonstructural design of the urban landscape.",None,None,None
