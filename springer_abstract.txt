Specifically, both total investment costs and flooding risk have been greatly reduced by the optimal implementation of the detention tank and LID measures.

In this paper, therefore, the authors propose two ecosystem services- and disservices-based methods (i.e. vegetation structure cover-abundance examination and cultural ecosystem services and disservices variables appraisal) to aid SuDS designers to distinguish and link amenity and biodiversity benefits, and allow initial site assessments to be performed in a cost-effective and reliable fashion. Forty-nine representative sites within Greater Manchester were selected to test the two methods. Amenity and biodiversity were successfully assessed and habitat for species, carbon sequestration, recreation and education ecosystem services scores were produced, which will support SuDS retrofit design decision-making.

Substantial questions remain about the hydraulic performance and the accumulation of pollutants in systems over the long term. Data of metal accumulation of systems with operational times >10\u00a0years currently is limited. This study deals with the accumulation of metals in a variety of long-term operational bioretention systems (11\u201322\u00a0years) to derive further operation recommendations for the water authorities.Materials and methodsThe hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention systems in field was measured using a double ring infiltrometer. Media soil samples from 22 diverse designed systems were collected across the surface and at intervals up to a depth of 65\u00a0cm to determine the spatial accumulation of Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd. Leaching experiments of selected bioretention media soils were derived to assess the metal leachability by water.Results and discussionThe hydraulic performance of most bioretention systems still met the technical guidelines of Germany even after long-term operation. Considerable metal accumulation occurred in the topsoil (0\u201320\u00a0cm). Median concentrations of all metals are highest at the soil surface (0\u201310\u00a0cm), decreasing with increasing depth. High concentrations were determined at the inflow points of the runoff waters, whereas concentrations at more than 1.5\u00a0m distance from the inflow were only slightly increased compared to the initial soil concentrations. Leachability tests have shown that most of the metals deposited in bioretention soils are only slightly water soluble. No concentrations exceeding the threshold values of the German Soil Contamination Ordinance for the pathway soil to groundwater could be determined.ConclusionsThe hydraulic conductivity of the bioretention systems is given even well after long-term operation. Most of the metal accumulation is concentrated in the top 20\u00a0cm; concentrations decrease rapidly and mostly reach background/initial concentrations after depths of 30\u00a0cm. The water-soluble metals are all below the trigger values of the German Soil Act.

Although arguably important to developing solutions for many societal issues, more often than not, students have limited exposure to the geosciences in high school or college. To address this geoscience literacy problem, the Interdisciplinary Teaching of Geoscience for a Sustainable Future (InTeGrate) Talent Expansion Center has engaged members of the geoscience community and their colleagues in allied disciplines to implement and support strategies to teach geoscience in the context of societal issues and vice versa. Place-based learning is a particularly useful educational practice in helping link geoscience concepts to societal issues and other disciplines. The three examples from three distinctly different institutions of higher education\u2014University of Utah, Metropolitan State University, and West Chester University\u2014demonstrate the use of place-based educational strategies to connect the geosciences to societal challenges. Each of these courses uses variations of place-based pedagogy to provide students from a variety of disciplines the opportunity to learn about geoscience concepts in the context of environmental challenges in their own area. Each example describes the course in the context of its institutional setting, student audience, type of course, and learning outcomes; the geoscience-related societal challenges addressed, a description of pedagogical strategies, basic assessment information, and reflections on lessons learned and recommendations. These three examples illustrate that local places\u2014on-campus, the surrounding community, and regional landscapes\u2014provide a plethora of opportunities for students to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world issues. The extent to which an instructor will take advantage of the place-based opportunities is only limited by the imagination of the instructor(s) and the extent to which they want to use these pedagogies to achieve their learning objectives. Teaching geoscience in the context of societal issues using place-based educational practices illuminate the process of geoscience and build interdisciplinary problem-solving skills that connect geoscience to economic, societal, and policy issues related to a range of issues.

Analysis reveals that GI can be organised into four main GI categories: (a) tree canopy, (b) green open spaces, (c) green roofs and (d) vertical greenery systems (facades/walls). Green open spaces and tree canopy attracted the attention of researchers due to their complexity, variability and important roles in GI planning. Evidence suggests that a ternary approach in terms of the functional (purpose, use, services), structural (morphology) and configurational (spatial arrangements) attributes of GI should be applied for a more comprehensive classification.

In this paper, an integrated simulation method to analyze the influence of urban rainstorms on waterlogging and traffic congestion was developed.

These areas tended to also have the most existing tree canopy on both private residential lands and the public right of way.

In an urban mosaic, a myriad of social and ecological components factor into aggregating and managing land to maintain or increase the flow of ecosystem services associated with green spaces.

While technological advances to upgrade human systems, e.g., in agriculture, urban planning, pollution abatement, and green energy development, are critical, these technical advances are insufficient on their own. Effective FEWS management depends on understanding human decision-making, including adaptations to new environmental, social, or economic changes and the responses of individuals and communities to new technologies intended to improve FEWS resilience and sustainability. This paper draws on multiple social science perspectives, including decision science, economics, and sociology, to consider the fundamental role that human behavior and adaptations play in FEWS. We discuss the importance of accounting for human behavior within a coupled human-natural systems framework in which a range of human adaptations and feedbacks are considered, including how humans might respond directly to press-pulse dynamics and indirectly through their adoption of new technology. Following a brief summary of key concepts of decision-making theory at individual and community scales, we then focus on migration and land use changes, the two types of human adaptations that are particularly important for FEWS modeling and management.

Worldwide, urban areas are increasing in size, both in land area and in population, causing losses of vegetated lands, increases in impervious surface cover, and increased demands on existing infrastructure and upon municipal services such as water and waste management. Urbanization, by reducing vegetative cover and increasing impervious surfaces, alters hydrologic cycles by reducing infiltration, increasing runoff volume and rates, lowering groundwater tables, decreasing evapotranspiration, and creating precipitation anomalies. Urban greenspaces are recognized as providing environmental benefits, including reduced stormwater runoff, increased evapotranspiration, and increased subsurface infiltration, which, in turn, raise groundwater tables. Urban agriculture forms a greenspace that can provide these environmental benefits, among others, in addition to contributing to food security for local populations. This chapter provides an overview of urban agriculture and its potential benefits. Then, we provide a case study based upon the City of Roanoke, Virginia, USA. We identify areas of existing urban agriculture using aerial imagery. We discuss land available for potential new urban agricultural sites. From aerial images and city geospatial data, we identify and calculate roof areas that can be used to capture rainwater. Then using precipitation data and equations identified from the literature, we calculated amounts of rainwater that could be harvested to provide irrigation water for these locations. Finally, we discuss reductions that could occur in stormwater runoff and greenhouse gas emissions if harvested rainwater were used instead of municipal water supplies.

School gardens are currently experiencing a resurgence in popularity in many Western countries following their decline after WWII. Rationales for contemporary school gardens are focused on issues that today\u2019s children face, such as inflexible education systems, obesity, diminishing experiences with nature, and a lack of physical activity. Although lauded by their champions (e.g., researchers, educational and landscape professionals, celebrities), the school garden remains a tenuous construct both as an entity and an educational tool. This is due to lack of consistent empirical evidence about their role in learning, plus their reliance on teacher knowledge and commitment, fundraising potential, and volunteer assistance.Yet school gardens can provide spaces for many experiences in nature ranging from play, exercise, and socialization to learning in maths, science, and environmental education. The focus of this chapter is examining their potential for environmental learning and fostering positive environmental experiences and attitudes.It is proposed that many current school gardens may be limited both in their scope and levels of children\u2019s participation, especially in areas such as planning and design.

Initially, stormwater management concerned itself primarily with abating downstream flooding and was the sole domain of engineers. As the regulatory climate changed over time, so did design philosophy, along with the types of management practices, the computational methods, and the prominence of stormwater management as an integral part of the overall site planning process. The milestones of this evolution include the addition of stormwater quality treatment as a regulatory standard and, more recently, a focus on reducing the overall volume of runoff through the use of small-scale, distributed management practices (often under the banner of Low-Impact Development or Environmental Site Design). The volume reduction strategy, referred to as \u201crunoff reduction,\u201d has been adopted as a regulatory standard in some parts of the USA, along with new stormwater practice design specifications and computational methods. The approach demands that stormwater design reach beyond sole reliance on engineering, as the new best management practices (BMPs) include site design strategies that incorporate elements of soil science, horticulture, landscape architecture, and, importantly, site planning. These new strategies have certainly been elevated to prominence by virtue of the hydrologic benefits but also by the integration of stormwater management into Clean Water Act permits and Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) assigned to impaired urban streams and receiving waterbodies.
